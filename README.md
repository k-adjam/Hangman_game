# Hangman_game

Functionality <br />
The program simulates a hangman game, where players can choose a topic for the word to be 
guessed by pressing the start button. Once a topic is selected, players can enter letters to 
guess the word. If the player fails to guess the word after six incorrect letters, a pop-up 
window will appear, providing information about the loss and revealing the drawn word. <br />
If a previously guessed letter or a non-alphabetic character is entered, the game will display 
an error message. <br />
At the end of the game, regardless of the outcome, a pop-up appears, asking the player if 
they want to play again. If the player chooses ‘Yes’, the game resets, allowing them to select a 
new topic. Pressing the 'No' button closes the game. <br />
Located at the top left corner is the game menu, offering the choice to initiate a fresh game 
(upon pressing the button, a message revealing the drawn word appears) or exit the game.
